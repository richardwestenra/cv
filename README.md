[Curriculum Vitae](https://www.richardwestenra.com/cv)
===============

This is my CV. It's a static HTML/SCSS site built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted on GitHub Pages. It's mobile/print-friendly, and can be converted to PDF by printing from the browser.

### Development

Install Ruby (with rbenv ideally), then run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` to start development.
